# Dynamic programming

A problem can be solved with dynamic programming if it has 2 properties:

1. Optimal substructure - that is, you can split it into smaller subproblems, divide and conquer.
2. Overlapping subproblems - when you split into smaller subproblems, subproblems appear more than once. 

## Subset sum problem

See [subset_sum](sub_setsum)

Given a list L and a number X, find whether any subset of L has sum = X
For instance, for L = [-7, -3, -2, 5, 8] and X = 0, the answer is True - [-3, -2, 5]
